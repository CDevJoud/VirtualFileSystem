## VirtualFileSystem (Single-Header C++ Library)

A lightweight, single-header virtual file system written in C++ for embedding and managing file-like data structures in memory. It supports both in-memory and file-based input streams, directory parsing, content packing, and provides an extendable interface for exploring virtual files. Designed for modular use in projects that require customizable and sandboxed file management without relying on the host filesystem.

### Features
- ✅ Memory and file-based input stream support  
- 📦 JSON-driven file structure conversion  
- 🔢 Custom versioning and content header system  
- 🖥️ Console output logging (configurable)  
- 🧭 Optional explorer interface for file enumeration  
- 📄 Single-header implementation for easy integration

### Use Cases
- Embedding file resources in applications  
- Building tools or engines that require custom VFS layers  
- Managing virtual assets with versioning
